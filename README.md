Amp-MIDI-Controller is a DIY build guide plus software for a flexible control module that lets you connect any MIDI foot controller to common guitar amp models and/or other MIDI interfaces using a simple configuration.

A built-in Teach Mode allows you to quickly “learn” and map specific MIDI signals, route them to different targets, and even create chained actions (multiple commands triggered by a single footswitch press).

Why this exists

Many tube amp manufacturers do not provide a way to switch the effects loop (Send/Return) via foot control. In practice, that often forces guitarists into the classic “pedalboard dance” when switching channels and toggling the loop separately.

Amp-MIDI-Controller solves this by allowing you to logically link amp channels to the effects loop, so your MIDI foot controller can change channels and switch the loop in a coordinated, predictable way.

Expandable design

At the highest configuration level, the module can even extend an amp to support two independent effects loops, adding more flexibility for channel-based routing and setups.

Display-driven workflow

An integrated display lets you select amp models and channels and makes it easy to pair the system with virtually any MIDI foot controller.
